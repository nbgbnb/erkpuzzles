# NBG's puzzle widget

## Overview
This project aims to create extensible components for creating puzzles, with satisfying ux.

### Roadmap

#### 0.1
> Clicky Boxes
> - basic grid functionality
> - scalable grid size
> - tiles report click events
> - tile properties easily accessible and assignable from parent component

#### 0.2
>  Better clicky boxes
> - encapsulate grid in a puzzle component
> - consolidate styling options
> - Think about cell traversal, implement some methods for it
> - (getNeighborsInGroup, checkEdges, etc)
> - ((ordinality enum?))
> - automatically assign row and column groups

#### 0.3
> Logical clicky boxes

> - Write POC logic to allow grid events to check conditions and alter affected tiles
> - implement POC logic to check for a win condition



#### 1.0
- functional LITS puzzle

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
